**Subject**: Request for Exception from Security Vulnerability Scan for Application A

**Dear Application Security Team**,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an exception for Application A from the upcoming security vulnerability scan, which generates tickets on the product scorecard.

**Reason for Exception**:
Application A is scheduled for decommissioning in the near future, and it does not make sense to allocate resources to fix vulnerabilities in an application that will soon be retired.

**Impact Assessment**:
- The impact of any existing vulnerabilities in Application A is minimal as the application is accessible only to internal teams and is not publicly accessible.
- Emphasizing the non-public nature of Application A, we believe it is reasonable to grant an exception for this application from the security vulnerability scan, including for critical vulnerabilities.

Given these factors, we kindly request that Application A be exempted from the security vulnerability scan and the associated ticket generation process.

Thank you for considering this request. Please let me know if you need any further information or have any concerns.

**Best regards,**
