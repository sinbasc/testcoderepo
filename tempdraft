Currently, the email address Stacey.Mawson@morningstar.com is listed in PRH, while brapp shows Stacey.Mawson@dbrsmorningstar.com. When the sync system went live, we backfilled existing contacts from PRH into the sync system database. During this process, the email Stacey.Mawson@dbrsmorningstar.com was synced from PRH, indicating that this contact was present in PRH at the time of backfill, and it was mapped to the relevant issuer in the sync system. In brapp, it is mapped to the deal/document.
However, the email Stacey.Mawson@dbrsmorningstar.com is no longer present in PRH. For a contact to be mapped to a deal or document, it must exist in PRH. Our system is designed to add new contacts as needed, but since the initial backfill indicated that Stacey.Mawson@dbrsmorningstar.com was already present in PRH, it attempted to map this contact to the deal or document. As a result, since the deal/document in brapp was mapped to Stacey.Mawson@dbrsmorningstar.com, which is now absent in PRH, the system could not update this contact as the lead.
Please let me know if further clarification or action is required.
