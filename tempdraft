Issues Identified:
DNS Name Change and SQS Address Configuration: These were not set in accordance with our Disaster Recovery (DR) plan.
Coding Error and Review Miss: A coding error slipped through due to inadequate review processes.
Plan to Address These Issues:
Implement code reviews for smaller changes instead of waiting for full functionality PR reviews. This will help catch errors earlier in the development cycle.
Health Check for Post-Production Sanity:
Given our event-driven architecture, we propose publishing a test document to ensure post-production sanity. This document will be deleted immediately after the publishing process is complete. However, considering the sensitive nature of the application, this strategy requires approval from the relevant stakeholders.
