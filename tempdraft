Subject: Urgent Recommendation to Prioritize Event-Based Solution for Employee Table Decommissioning
Dear Team,
I wanted to follow up on our discussions regarding the migration of the brapp database, specifically the employee table. While the lift-and-shift approach to Data Hub provides a temporary fix by preventing unauthorized edits, I believe it’s critical to prioritize the previously accepted event-based solution now to avoid long-term pitfalls. Below, I’ll outline key reasons why this should take precedence over delaying it in favor of other initiatives.
	1	Quantify the Escalating Cost of Delayed Modernization: Relying solely on lift-and-shift could lead to significantly higher operational expenses—industry benchmarks suggest up to 45% more in cloud costs due to inefficiencies from the legacy design. By implementing the event-driven approach immediately, we can achieve quick ROI through automated real-time syncing from Active Directory, reducing manual efforts and preventing the compounding of technical debt. Postponing this risks making future refactoring 2-3 times more costly as the outdated structure becomes entrenched in Data Hub.
	2	Address Hidden Security and Compliance Vulnerabilities: The lift-and-shift doesn’t resolve potential security gaps in the old code or ensure robust audit trails for data changes. An event-driven system would introduce immutable event logs, improving traceability and aligning with compliance standards like GDPR. Prioritizing this now acts as a proactive measure to mitigate risks of breaches or regulatory fines, especially if upcoming priorities involve sensitive data handling.
	3	Position It as a Low-Risk Entry to Broader Transformation: With the design already approved, starting now on the employee table creates a modular, reusable pattern for decommissioning other brapp components. This low-risk step builds team expertise in event-driven architecture without a full overhaul, avoiding the rigidity that lift-and-shift imposes. It sets us up for smoother integrations in the future, ensuring we don’t hinder other strategic initiatives.
I propose we scope this as an MVP to minimize bandwidth impact while demonstrating immediate value. Let’s discuss how this fits into the quarter’s priorities—I’m confident it will accelerate our overall modernization goals.
