Process Gains: This project was successfully developed through the close collaboration between Team A and Team B, ensuring it was delivered in a timely manner.
Technical Gains:
In addition to fostering cross-team collaboration, this initiative required direct collaboration between the two teams, with data collectively passed to APIs for end users, representing a third stream. Architecturally, this project provided valuable experience in managing multiple enterprise-level interactions.
The project implemented a document link generation process for external APIs to consume, signed by CloudFront and protected by WAF rules. This security measure ensures that in the event of a cyber attack on downstream systems, the URL cannot be accessed from unauthorized networks, thereby safeguarding our private data.
Gains to End Users: This system streamlines the data transfer from System A to System B. Previously, users had to manually recreate deals in both systems and upload documents separately. With this initiative, these repetitive tasks have been eliminated, resulting in a 40% reduction in the time spent on these activities. This efficiency not only enhances user productivity but also allows them to focus on more valuable tasks.
This comprehensive initiative has demonstrated significant improvements in process efficiency, technical security, and user productivity, while also providing valuable architectural experience in handling multi-enterprise data flows.
