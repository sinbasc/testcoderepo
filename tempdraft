Subject: Update on Brapp Sync Issue and Debugging Efforts
Dear [Recipient],
To address a sporadic issue causing object deletions in a loop during Brapp sync, we added debug logs to identify the root cause. As part of this effort, we modified the Brapp ID field in one of the methods. However, in a rare edge case, the absence of a Brapp ID in the collection led to a code failure.
We are actively investigating this and will keep you updated on our progress.
Best regards,â€¨[Your Name]
