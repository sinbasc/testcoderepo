Following our call, I wanted to clarify the procedure for updating the lead and rating analysts in the PRH APIs. Currently, both the lead and rating analysts are replaced when we send updates to the PRH APIs. However, if the rating analyst is not set in Insight, we are leaving the rating analyst field blank in PRH, which does not meet the expected behavior.
Going forward, we should ensure that the rating analyst field in PRH is only replaced if a rating analyst is set in Insight. If no rating analyst is set in Insight, the existing rating analyst in PRH should remain unchanged. However, if a rating analyst is set in Insight, it will replace the existing rating analyst in PRH.
Please let me know if there are any questions or further clarifications needed.
