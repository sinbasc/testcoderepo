Following our meeting with A and B, where we discussed the testing strategy for application code changes versus configuration and unit test changes, we have now documented the details in the codebase. You can find the information in the README file at the following URL.
We have started documenting with this project, and we will continue to do so for all subsequent projects. Could you please take a look and let us know if you have any feedback? Also, it would be great if you could share this with D and E.
