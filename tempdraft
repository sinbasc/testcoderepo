The sporadic issues with the api.dbrs.com domain on the internal network stem from the CSR router being switched off, coupled with the fact that the dbrs.com domain has not yet been migrated to the CR production account. This presents an ideal opportunity to eliminate our codeâ€™s dependency on the dbrs.com domain.
To proceed, we should select a preferred domain name to replace api.dbrs.com and submit a request to Central Tech for its registration, as we do not control the Morningstar domain. In the interim, if we cannot afford to wait for the time required to create these records, we can implement the following workaround:
We can add an entry in our CR production Route 53 using the crcc2f9.eas.morningstar.com domain (which we control) and configure it to forward requests to , located in the CR production account. We would then update our code to reference this new DNS entry, thereby removing the dependency on the dbrs.com domain. Once we finalize the domain name and Central Tech creates the entry, we can revise the code accordingly.
