	1	This issue did not occur earlier because the database is part of a shared cluster, and at that specific point in time, the overall load on the database was unusually high due to concurrent activities, which had not been the case previously. From reviewing online resources, another common factor could be sudden traffic bursts or long-running queries that cause connections to accumulate unexpectedly.
	2	Connection pooling will maintain a fixed pool of reusable database connections, ensuring less load on the database by limiting new connection creations despite our systemâ€™s aggressive calls. Additionally, it prevents overload by capping the maximum active connections and efficiently managing resources during peaks, reducing latency through connection reuse.
