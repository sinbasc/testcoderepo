Hi Mayur,
This alert was triggered due to an error from the external PRH APIs while our application was attempting to add a deal. The error message indicated that the deal already exists.
We verified this by checking the PRH API via Postman, which confirmed that the deal is indeed present. This suggests the deal was added manually in the PRH application, causing our synchronization process to fail.
As a reminder, we have previously communicated to users that deals and mappings should not be added manually in the PRH application, as this can disrupt our systemâ€™s functionality.
I have reached out to the product team to inquire further about this issue.
