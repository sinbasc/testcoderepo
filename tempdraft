Issues Identified:
DNS Name Change and SQS Address Configuration: These were not set in accordance with our Disaster Recovery (DR) plan.
Coding Error and Review Miss: A coding error slipped through due to inadequate review processes.
Plan to Address These Issues:
Implement code reviews for smaller changes instead of waiting for full functionality PR reviews. This will help catch errors earlier in the development cycle.
Health Check for Post-Production Sanity:
Given our event-driven architecture, we propose publishing a test document to ensure post-production sanity. This document will be deleted immediately after the publishing process is complete. However, considering the sensitive nature of the application, this strategy requires approval from the relevant stakeholders.


const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');
const db = require('./database'); // Placeholder for your database connection logic

async function createExcel() {
    // Fetch the paragraph from the database
    const paragraph = await db.fetchParagraph();

    // Calculate the number of cells to merge based on the paragraph length
    const length = paragraph.length;
    const cellsToMerge = Math.ceil(length / 20); // Adjust the divisor as per your requirement

    // Create a new Excel workbook and worksheet
    const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
    const worksheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Sheet1');

    // Add the paragraph to the first cell
    const cell = worksheet.getCell('A1');
    cell.value = paragraph;

    // Merge cells based on the calculated number
    worksheet.mergeCells(1, 1, 1, cellsToMerge);

    // Save the workbook to a file
    await workbook.xlsx.writeFile('output.xlsx');
    console.log('Excel file created successfully');
}

// Execute the function
createExcel().catch(console.error);
