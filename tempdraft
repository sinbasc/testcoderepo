Here’s a revised version of your email correcting the mention of “modifying” to “type casting” the Brapp ID field:

Subject: Update on Brapp Sync Issue and Debugging Efforts Dear [Recipient],
To address a sporadic issue causing object deletions in a loop during Brapp sync, we added debug logs to identify the root cause. As part of this effort, we type cast the Brapp ID field to an integer in one of the methods. However, in a rare edge case, the absence of a Brapp ID in the collection led to a code failure.
We are actively investigating this and will keep you updated on our progress.
Best regards, [Your Name]

This version accurately reflects that the Brapp ID is being type cast to an integer rather than modified. Let me know if you need further refinements!
