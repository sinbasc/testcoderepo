Subject: Follow-Up on Cluster Provisioning Discussion
Dear Mayur,
Thank you for our discussion yesterday regarding the cluster provisioning strategy. Based on our conversation, I recommend initiating with a higher-capacity cluster, aligned with the production environment’s specifications. This approach will effectively support the four non-production environments we plan to maintain.
I’ve consulted with Rugved on the cost estimates, and he has finalized the details. He will update the relevant ticket with this information. Kindly review and provide your approval, after which we can proceed with the cluster setup.
Please let me know if you need any additional details.
Best regards, [Your Name]
