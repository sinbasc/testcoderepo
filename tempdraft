 Yes, when we call any API for an update, we send all unchanged attributes along with the updated ones. We will first need to verify if their API functions correctly without sending the region during the update. If it does, we can proceed to remove the region from the update in our code. We can also discuss other fields that have similar requirements and may necessitate code changes.
